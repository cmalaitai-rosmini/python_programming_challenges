# 11 Formatting an Address
# A program is required to store a users address in a single string. The user should be asked three questions:
# What is your house number?
# What is the name of your street?
# What town do you live in?
#The program will then combine the users answers in a single string with each answer being separated by a comma and store the result. Finally the program will display the result on the screen.
