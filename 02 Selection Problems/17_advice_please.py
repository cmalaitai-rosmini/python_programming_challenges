# 17 Advice Please (Part 2)
# As a carâ€™s tyres and brakes wear out it takes longer for a car to stop. A list of recommended stopping distances are shown below.
# 20 miles per hour 6 metres to stop
# 30mph 14m
# 40mph 24m
# 50mph 38m
# 60mph 55m
# 70mph 75m
# Write a program to analyse a braking distance test. The user should be asked to enter the speed (mph) they were doing and the distance (m) it took them to stop. If the distance is longer than the recommended stopping distance the user should be advised to go for a tyre and brake check.
