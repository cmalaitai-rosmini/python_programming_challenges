# 15 Charity Collection
# Three friends have been collecting money for charity. A local company has offered to double the amount of money they collect if they raise over Â£1000. Write a program that allows the friends to enter there individual amounts. The program should then add the three amounts and store the total. If the total is greater or equal to 1000 the total should be doubled. Finally the total should be displayed.
